This repository contains the data and code used for the Daily Cal's Nov. 2016 project investigating gender diversity in UC Berkeley's computer science program.

* `degrees.csv` contains raw data from Cal Answers -- degrees awarded by year, by department and by gender
* `cs_analysis.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook analyzing that data, producing statistics for the story and and generating CSVs for the graphics
* `site/` is a Jekyll static site serving the article and an interactive seating chart at `/graphic/`
