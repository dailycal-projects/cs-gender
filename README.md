This repository contains the data and code used for the Daily Cal's Nov. 2016 project investigating gender diversity in UC Berkeley's computer science program.

* `degrees.csv` contains degrees awarded by year, by department and by gender
* `cs_analysis.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook analyzing that data, producing statistics for the story and and generating files for the graphics
* `graphic/` is a Jekyll static site serving the article and the graphic

The line graph is from NPR's [dailygraphics](https://github.com/nprapps/dailygraphics) code.
