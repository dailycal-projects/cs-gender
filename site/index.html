      <p>“Um, this is 61C section.”</p>
      <p>  Those were the words Alex Dotterweich heard when she walked into the first meeting of her computer science class. A male student stared at her, puzzled, assuming she had walked into the wrong room.</p>
      <p>  Dotterweich, a third-year cognitive science major, can’t help but think her classmate’s comment had something to do with her appearance. She’s a classically trained ballerina with long blonde hair and a penchant for floral skirts – and she’s one of very few women in her section</p>
      <p>  In the 2015-16 academic year, 89 percent of degrees awarded by the campus Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department went to male students. That's the highest proportion of male graduates of any department. In comparison, 68 percent of the math department graduates were male</p>
      <p>  When she started at UC Berkeley, Dotterweich, whose high school didn’t offer computer science, thought she might major in English. But in her first semester on campus, she developed an interest in artificial intelligence.</p>
      <p>  “I really liked CS,” Dotterweich said. “But as I went along there were not a lot of people like me in those classes.”</p>
      <p>  After taking the introductory courses, however, she missed the GPA cutoff to declare the computer science major by one-tenth of a point. She plans to graduate with a CS minor instead</p>
      <p>  To declare the computer science major, students must earn a 3.3 GPA in three introductory courses: 61A, 61B and 70. In the 2016 fall semester, the average GPA across those three classes was 3.14, according to campus data</p>
      <p>  To be average in these courses is not quite good enough — the EECS major major in the College of Engineering and the computer science major in the College of Letters and Sciences are two of the most competitive majors on campus. They are also two of the majors with the fewest proportion of female graduates</p>
      <p>  These facts have not gone unnoticed by the administration. The campus computer science department has dedicated resources and attention to improving the experience of female students graduating with computer science degrees. They are also engaged in efforts to broaden access to computer science for students across campus. Yet, some students find that the everyday experience of being a female undergraduate in Berkeley’s computer science program can be alienating.</p>

      <h3><span style="color:#45ffff;">[0]</span> 'In on the joke'</h3>
      <p>To be a computer science student at UC Berkeley is to occupy an elite position on campus and in the country. In 2016, the campus accepted 8 percent of applicants to the EECS major, compared to 17.5 percent for the campus as a whole. A degree from UC Berkeley’s highly-regarded computer science program can be a ticket to some of the most lucrative jobs in the world, many located nearby in Silicon Valley.</p>

      <p>These factors form an impression of the computer science community as an exclusive enclave on campus — one that is largely male. This can deter female students from applying to the program and make those already enrolled feel self-conscious.

      <p>The UC Berkeley computer science student caricatured in memes and internet groups is a white or Asian male, socially awkward — especially with girls — boba in hand as he pulls the third consecutive all-nighter in his unwashed Dropbox t-shirt.</p>

      <p>In a similar vein, the memes caricature those who aren’t computer scientists: women are sometimes portrayed as clueless, surrounded by throngs of men only too willing to help. According to Jingyi Li, a senior EECS major, the community has a “culture that prides itself on being politically incorrect and spending a lot of time on the internet.”</p>

      <p>To some, especially those on the outside, it’s unclear whether the memes are just jokes or if they acknowledge a genuine attitude of some in the community. Last fall, a student created a website parodying the self-congratulatory cliquishness of a “specific subculture within the EECS undergraduate community,” becoming infamous for its use of the description “EECS Master Race.”</p>

      <p>Only a small group of computer science students take the memes seriously, according to Tsu-Jae King Liu, the former chair of the EECS department. But their popularity points to the exclusion that women and others might feel in the major.</p>

      <p>Just as the stereotype of a male programmer is a “nerdy guy,” according to Shah, the image of the female hacker is similarly one-dimensional. She’s sometimes “felt weird if (she) wore a dress or had painted nails,” while wearing jeans and a t-shirt has allowed her to be part of technical conversations, she said.</p>

      <h3><span style="color:#45ffff;">[1]</span> 'Playing catch-up'</h3>

      <p>Faculty and department staff argue that the gender imbalance partially results from a lack of encouragement for women to pursue computer science in high school. Last year, only about 19 percent of EECS applicants were female, according to campus data.</p>

      <p>The department has attempted to lower the barrier to entry for students without previous experience to pursue computer science. Though the introductory course, CS 61A, makes no explicit requirements about previous experience, it’s widely known for its incomprehensibility, leaving students without prior exposure “totally lost,” according to senior EECS major Max Kanwal.</p>

      <p>“On average, women come in with less computing experience than men,” said John DeNero, a campus computer science professor who teaches 61A. “Succeeding in a rigorous first computer science course is always easier if you’ve done some of it before.”</p>

      <p>In 2013 the campus introduced CS 10, “The Beauty and Joy of Computing,” which provides a more accessible introduction for those intending to pursue the major and a survey of the subject’s core topics for non-majors. According to the department website, half of the students in CS 10 are women.</p>

      <p>The numbers are promising. In the 2010-11 academic year, only ten percent of the degrees awarded in computer science went to female students. Each year since then, a greater proportion of female students have graduated in computer science. In 2016, the proportion was 20 percent.</p>

      <p>But the campus is not just concerned with the number of female students graduating with computer science degrees. For EECS professor Anant Sahai, broadening access should not entail lowering the standards of one of the nation’s most prestigious programs.</p>

      <p>“If we stopped delivering a top-tier education, it doesn't really matter if we're inclusive,” Sahai said. “That's not what inclusion means. Inclusion means we deliver a top-tier education and we let everyone into it.”</p>

      <h3><span style="color:#45ffff;">[2]</span> 'In cold water'</h3>

      <p>Itzel Martinez, a senior EECS major, spent her 19th birthday in Soda Hall finishing a class project. The building, home to the campus computer science department, is often full of sleep-deprived project teams camping out until the early hours of the morning.</p>

      <p>For many, succeeding in project-based computer science classes depends on their ability to find a group for support and collaboration. Interest in the computer science major has far outpaced the number of seats available adding the catalyst of competition to courses that inherently require working with fellow students. This semester, more than 1,200 students are enrolled in CS 61A.</p>

      <p>Students who don’t already know computer science classmates from high school or pre-college programs can find it difficult to find a group in which they’re comfortable. To address this, the department offers CS Kickstart, a pre-college program, and CS Scholars, which provides supplementary seminars and advising targeting students underrepresented in computer science.</p>
      <p>The department has also restructured its large lower-division classes to help those who lack a strong computer science background. By de-emphasizing lecture attendance and stressing personal attention in sections and labs, the department attempts to give students without previous exposure the opportunity to succeed.</p>

      <p>Larger classes can increase the amount of attention students get, Sahai said. When there are enough TAs to hold office hours throughout the week and host “homework parties” to encourage collaboration, students have a better experience than in smaller but more poorly-resourced courses, he argues.</p>

      <p>But despite the frequency of TA office hours, Soda Hall is known for long lines and overcrowded offices. That means it’s still difficult to get personal attention in large introductory classes.</p>

      <p>“Even though I really liked my professors, it’s definitely not hand-hold-y at all. You’re definitely left on your own a lot,” said Anusha Syed, a junior computer science major.  “I felt like I was thrown into cold water.”</p>

      <h3><span style="color:#45ffff;">[3]</span> 'Excluded from inclusion'</h3>

      <p>Though the department has reworked its course structure to boost the number of women graduating from the computer science program, the unconsciously sexist behavior that can discourage female students is harder to tackle.</p>

      <p>“I get a lot of (female) students that will tell me that they do feel their abilities are questioned oftentimes,” said Tiffany Reardon, the EECS director of diversity and achievement. “Maybe it'll be a lab partner that'll say, ‘Well, how did you come up with that?’ …  or they'll kind of second-guess, ‘Well, let me ask someone else.’”</p>

      <p>Female faculty are role models for many female students — living proof that success in computer science is not reserved for males. However, no female faculty member currently teaches a lower-division computer science course. It is not uncommon for sophomores or juniors to have only taken classes from male professors.</p>

      <p>Along with sending students to conferences that celebrate women’s achievements in computing, the department requires TAs be trained in the ways gender discrimination can play out in the classroom and create an unwelcoming environment.</p>

      <p>Despite the conversations about diversity held on and off campus, “if we have workshops on equity and inclusion, the people who show up are not the people who need to be educated,” Liu said.</p>

      <p>But while the number of women in computer science is increasing, those who feel like outsiders for other reasons — race or class background, for example — might still be left behind.</p>

      <p>“There’s simply not enough women who are Hispanic or Black to have an organization that supports these students,” said Gireeja Ranade, a former instructor in the EECS department. “I’ve taught classes where there was maybe one African-American student total.”</p>

      <p>In addition, gender-based student groups and department programs are organized to support those who identify as female, and don’t focus explicitly on those who fall outside the gender binary.</p>

      <p>“In EECS, I’ve felt like I’ve had to hide my non-binary identity to engage with fellow students on the subject material,” Li said.</p>

      <h3><span style="color:#45ffff;">[4]</span> 'What money can't buy'</h3>

      <p>For Sahai, these problems could be alleviated with more resources: more funding for a greater number and more diverse assortment of TAs, more space for homework parties, more studies on inclusion. But the campus hasn’t been willing to approach the conversation about funding with diversity in mind, he said.</p>

      <p>“It's very easy to educate the privileged, white male (or Asian) student from Cupertino, because … their dad or mom has a Ph.D. in the subject and they'll explain it to them,” he said. “If we want to cut costs, we can deliver a very high-quality education to that student. But that's not what we should be doing.”</p>

      <p>Others say the exclusivity of the computer science community might not be so easily remedied. Additional resources might increase the number of women graduating from the major, but won’t necessarily diversify the computer science community.</p>

      <p>For those who don’t fit the computer science mold, department efforts only go so far. A broader cultural shift — one that would encompass a more inclusive image of the bona fide programmer — might be necessary. Until then, it’s difficult for some women to feel at home in computer science.</p>

      <p>“I've had a lot of friends who have dropped because it's too hard. And I don't blame them for saying it's too hard — they didn't have the support system.” Martinez said. “There's a lot that needs to be done.”</p>
